# afterthehacknight
Resources for keeping a project going after hacknight.

People learning to code need small projects to work on. Informal hack nights, where users start a casual project from the ground up are a perfect place to start, but too often the code gets lost, and the hacknight members do not see each other again. This project seeks to change that.

Idea:
1. Make it easy to save / place in an easy to access public space (like Github)
2. Make it easy for people to meetup for hack nights (like Meetup.com)
3. Keep things simple. 

This project is a work in progress. It doesn't have to change the world. A website, a wordpress plugin, or some app that leverages github's and meetup apis, etc, etc. is the immediate goal.
